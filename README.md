# rust-roguelike

Making a roguelike in Rust using libtcod. 
Initially I've been following [this excellent tutorial](https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/index.html),
which teaches you about all the new memory/borrowing stuff in Rust as well as libtcod and the meaty bits of a simple roguelike.

## Future plans
I've got an idea to make a cyberpunk roguelike with jacking-in and hacking - perhaps I'll finish the tutorial first, though.
